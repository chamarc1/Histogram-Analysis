# Histogram-Analysis
Python Applications for Lab4

This Python application allows users to load one of two CSV files and perform histogram analysis and plots for select variables on the datasets.

Data Description

The first dataset represents the population change for specific dates for U.S. regions, while the second dataset represents housing data over an extended period of time, describing home age, number of bedrooms, and other variables. The first row provides a column name for each dataset.

The following columns should be used to perform analysis:

PopChange.csv: Pop Apr 1, Pop Jul 1, Change Pop
Housing.csv: AGE, BEDRMS, BUILT, ROOMS, UTILITY
Please note that there are more columns in the Housing CSV file than are required to be analyzed, but they should still be loaded.

Count

To perform the analysis, please run the Python script and follow the instructions provided in the terminal.
